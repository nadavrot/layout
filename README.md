# Layout

Layout is a rust library and a stand alone utility that draws graphs. Layout
can parse Graphviz dot files and render them.

## Getting started

Build the crate and render some dot files with the command

```bash
cargo run --bin run ./inputs/bk.dot -o output.svg
```

## Gallery

This section presents a few graphs that were rendered from dot files:
